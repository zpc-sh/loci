## 2024-03-10 - Optimizing String Concatenation in Moonbit
**Learning:** Moonbit does not currently have a built-in `String::join` or `String::concat` for string arrays. The pattern of `out = out + items[i]` creates many intermediate strings and runs in O(N^2) time.
**Action:** Use `StringBuilder::new()` and `builder.write_string()` which runs in O(N) time for concatenating strings in loops in Moonbit.

## 2024-05-19 - Fast BFS Propagation for Tree Projections
**Learning:** In MoonBit, an O(N^2) loop checking presence in an expanding Map (`included.get(...) is Some(_)`) is very slow (12s for 2000 depth). Replacing it with an O(E) precomputation pass to map child-to-parent and an O(N) queue-based BFS propagation dramatically drops the time (to 0.12s).
**Action:** Always favor explicit work queues and adjacency maps over repeated N-passes for graph/tree propagation logic.
## 2024-05-04 - Lazy Loading CLI TUI Dependencies
**Learning:** Top-level `await` for heavy interactive CLI dependency imports (like `@clack/prompts`) in a Bun tool causes immediate overhead for all subcommands, including non-interactive ones (`help`, `status`).
**Action:** Defer heavy interactive UI imports into an asynchronous lazy initialization function (`export async function getClack()`) to eliminate cold start latency for non-interactive paths.
